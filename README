Description

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.30 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.30.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.30.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.30/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/drizzle-nginx-module
            --add-module=/path/to/rds-json-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    rds-json-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/rds-json-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.32)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.
